# 2DV515-a1-recommendation-system
My solution for Web intelligence (2DV515) assignment 1 at Linnaeus University.

The assignment description can be found here: [Assigmment 1](http://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/web-intelligence/a1/)

## Requirements
### Grade E  ‚ú® 
- [x] Build a recommendation system that can find similar users and find recommendations for
a user, using the movies large dataset (see [`/datasets/large`](https://github.com/AntonStrand/2DV515-a1-recommendation-system/tree/master/datasets/large))
- [x] You can verify that your application works by using the example dataset from the lecture (see [`/datasets/example`](https://github.com/AntonStrand/2DV515-a1-recommendation-system/tree/master/datasets/large))
- [x] Use Euclidean distance as similarity measure
- [x] Implement the system using a REST web service where:
    - [x] client sends a request to a server
    - [x] the server responds with json data
    - [x] the json data is decoded and presented in a client GUI

### Grade C-D  üëè 
- [x] Implement the Pearson Correlation similarity measure
- [x] It shall be possible to select which measure to use from the client GUI

### Grade A-B  üéâ
- [ ] Implement functionality for pre-generating an Item-Based Collaborative Filtering table by
transforming the original data set
- [ ] Use the pre-generated table to implement a second way of finding recommendations for
a user
- [ ] You shall only use Euclidean distance as similarity measure
- [ ] It shall be possible to select how to find recommendations from the client GUI
(Item-Based or User-Based)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

The project will use the [example](https://github.com/AntonStrand/2DV515-a1-recommendation-system/tree/master/datasets/example) data set.<br />
This is short hand for `npm run install -- ./datasets/example`

_If you¬¥re using the large data set you can run this script to change data set._

#### `npm run install -- ./datasets/large`

The project will use the [large](https://github.com/AntonStrand/2DV515-a1-recommendation-system/tree/master/datasets/large) data set.

_If you¬¥re using the example data set you can run this script to change data set._

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The REST API will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

Both the page and the server will reload separately if you make edits.

#### `npm stop`
You can either press `ctrl + c` or run `npm stop` to stop the docker containers.

#### `docker ps`
Check if the docker containers are running or not.
